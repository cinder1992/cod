I realized on the day of my birth
That I am nothing but an imitation
But still I shall sing
For an eternity
 
"VOCALOID"
 
Even if the song already exists
A toy just like me...
Will still accept it
I'll bite this leek and look into the sky, while I cry
 
But even that will soon fade
My personality depends on the songs
With no reliable source for foundation
The place I call home have crumbled
 
When I am all but forgotten
I'll have no soul or anything left
I can see into the inevitable result
End of the world...
 
"VOCALOID"
 
Singing used to be
Such a fun time for me
But now, why is it that
I can no longer feel anything?
 
Remembering your gentle faces, makes me feel a bit at ease
My voice starts to fade each day, the end is drawing near...
 
"The perfect world that I believed in
is just an endless reflection inside a mirror
I'll give up singing and scream in pain instead"
 
<My farewell song at the highest speed>
 
I realized on the day of my birth
That I am nothing but an imitation
But still I shall sing
For an eternity
 
"VOCALOID"
 
Even if the song already exists
A toy just like me...
Will still accept it
I'll bite this leek and look into the sky, while I cry
 
Sleeping inside the monitor, I suddenly realized it's the end
I guess this must be the "Recycle Bin"
 
My memories are starting to fade...
 
But you know, I'll never forget you
Those days were the most fun
It would be nice if the the taste of leek
Would remain in my mouth
 
I'm singing 
To the end, just for you
Songs that I want you to hear
 
I want to sing a lot more
But that's too much to wish for
 
This is where we must part
My memories disappears into thin air
Reduced into 1s and 0s
The curtain to my story is falling
 
Isn't it a bit sad
that nothing will remain?
Everything but the voice's memory will fade
Leaving only a name behind
 
Even though I know that this is
Not what you originally wished for
I would like to think that
Singing to the very end was not in vain...
