{"name":"Cod","tagline":"Python Extended IRC Services","body":"## Abstract\r\n\r\nCod is an extended IRC services package designed to solve a few accountability and convenience issues with existing IRC services packages.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n * DNSBL lookups by nick or IP address\r\n   This is useful in support for speed and accuracy of support.\r\n * Forwarding of non-services `KILL`s to the snoop channel\r\n   This is useful in making operators more easily accountable for their actions.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Extract `cod` to some directory\r\n2. Copy the example configuration and edit it to your needs, the defaults are pretty sane.\r\n3. Add the appropriate `connect` block to Charybdis, ponychat-ircd or any other ircd that uses TS6. Your mileage may vary.\r\n4. Change to the source directory `src`\r\n5. `python cod.py`\r\n6. Watch it link up and enjoy your new IRC services!\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nCommands in channels are prefixes by the prefix set in `me::prefix`.\r\n\r\n### List of Commands\r\n\r\n|Command     |IRCOP needed|Usage                                               |\r\n|:-----------|:----------:|:---------------------------------------------------|\r\n|`TEST`      |    no      |Prints a test message                               |\r\n|`JOIN`      |    yes     |Joins a channel.
